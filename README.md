# Livepeer Gateway

## Introduction

This page gives an introduction to Livepeer Gateway.

[Livepeer](https://livepeer.org) is a project to create a decentralised public network providing video infrastructure services, based on open-source software. [(Livepeer on github)](https://github.com/livepeer/), [(Livepeer Primer)](https://livepeer.org/primer).

The main objective is to help you install and operate a Gateway on a computer, and to learn how to interact with it.

## Overview

Livepeer Gateway is software to run on a computer or a server. It uses entirely open-source and freely available software.

A Livepeer Gateway can **receive** and **serve** streaming content. It can also be configured to transcode streaming content to improve accessibility of content.

The streaming content must be Video + Audio, and must be published into the Gateway in a linear stream. Content can be live (from camera and microphone) and / or recorded (from a disk).

It can **receive** streaming content published in `RTMP` format, from tools like [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/), [ManyCam](https://manycam.com/), [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/), or many other `rtmp` software libraries and tools.

It can **serve** streaming content over `http` with a `.m3u8` extension, for playback in tools like [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html), media-enabled Mobile browsers (Brave, Firefox or Chrome), embedded in an `html` page using a stream player such as `hls.js`, or inside a mobile application using something like [ExoPlayer](https://exoplayer.dev/).

## Minimum Setup

Here are instructions to setup a Livepeer Broadcaster on a local computer. They will work on Mac or Linux.

1. Download the latest release of pre-compiled software from [Livepeer's Release Page on Github](https://github.com/livepeer/go-livepeer/releases), under where it says **Assets**:

- On a Mac, download the `livepeer-darwin-amd64.tar.gz` file of the `livepeer-darwin-arm64.tar.gz` file to the _Downloads_ folder

- On Linux, download the `livepeer-linux-amd64.tar.gz` file

2. Unzip the file:

- On Mac, simply open the file, and it will extract to the folder containing the file (_Downloads_).

- On Linux, open the `livepeer-linux-amd64.tar.gz` file then click "Extract", and extract it to "Home".

3. Open `Terminal`, and navigate to the folder containing the `livepeer` binary:

- On Mac, run `cd Downloads/livepeer-darwin-amd64` or `cd Downloads/livepeer-darwin-arm64`

- On Linux, run `cd livepeer-linux-amd64`

4. Run `./livepeer -gateway`

5. Wait until the text `Video Ingest Endpoint - rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935` is displayed.

**Livepeer Gateway is now running.**
